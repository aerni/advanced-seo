Simply disable the feature in the config.

## Features

- Simple migration from Aardvark SEO and SEO Pro
- Sitemap

## Minimum Requirements
- PHP 8.0
- Statamic 3.3.8
- Laravel 8
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot#requirements) (Social Images Generator)

## Installation
Install the addon using Composer:

```bash
composer require aerni/advanced-seo
```

The config will be published to `config/advanced-seo.php` as part of the installation process. Make sure to check it out, as there are tons of configuration options to tailor the features to your needs.

## Getting Started
Add `{{ seo:head }}` somewhere between your `<head>` tags.

```html
<head>{{ seo:head }}</head>
```

 Add `{{ seo:body }}` after the opening `<body>` tag. Note that this tag is only needed when using Google Tag Manager.

```html
<body>{{ seo:body }}</body>
```

### Available Tags
| Tag               | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{ seo:head }}`  | Render the head view with the meta data                  |
| `{{ seo:body }}`  | Render the body view with the body data                  |
| `{{ seo:dump }}`  | Dump all the meta data of the current page               |
| `{{ seo:field }}` | Get the data of a specific field, e.g. `{{ seo:title }}` |

## Migration
Advanced SEO provides multiple migration scripts to get your content into shape. This is super handy when installing the addon into an existing site with lots of entries and terms. There are even migration scripts for popular addons such as `Aardvark SEO` and `SEO Pro`. Simply run the following command to migrate your entries and terms to the new data format:

```bash
php please seo:migrate
```

>**Note:** The migrator only migrates data saved on entries and terms. It does not migrate any config files, settings, and default data. There are just too many things that could go wrong. So you will have to migrate those yourself. This should be pretty straightforward and not take too much of your time.

## Concept & Usage
After installing the addon, you will find a new `SEO` section in the sidebar navigation in the control panel. You will also find a new `SEO` tab when editing your entries and terms.

Advanced SEO uses its own stache store to save site defaults and content defaults for your collection entries and taxonomy terms. The store is organized into three content types: `site`, `collections` and `taxonomies`.

The data will cascade down from the site defaults to the content defaults and finally to the entry/term.

### Site Defaults
The site defaults consist of thoughtfully organized site-wide settings for the likes of site name, noindex, social images, and analytics trackers. Head to `SEO -> Site` to configure the settings to your liking. Values configured here will be saved in `content/seo/site/`.

If your site is a multi-site, you will be able to localize the settings for each of your sites.

### Collection & Taxonomy Defaults
The collection and taxonomy defaults let you define default values for your entries and terms like title, description, social images, sitemap settings, etc. Head to `SEO -> Collections` or `SEO -> Taxonomies` to configure the defaults to your liking. Values configured here will be saved into `content/seo/collections/` or `content/seo/taxonomies/`.

If your site is a multi-site, you will be able to localize the data to the sites configured on the respective collection or taxonomy.

### Entries & Terms
The addon will add a new `SEO` tab to the blueprint of your entries and terms that bundles all the SEO-related settings. Advanced SEO ships with its own source fieldtype that will let you choose the value’s source. It consists of at least two options: `Default` and `Custom`. Some fields, e.g. `Meta Title`, will also give you the `Auto` option.

| Source    | Description                                 | Value             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `Auto`    | Inherits the value from a predefined field  | `@auto`           |
| `Default` | Inherits the value from the defaults        | `@default`        |
| `Custom`  | Overwrites the default value with your own  | Your custom value |

## Social Images Generator
The social images generator provides an easy way to add captivating images to your entries. It leverages [Browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) to convert your templates to an image. This means that you can design your images like a regular template, using variables, tags, partials, etc.

>**Note:** The generator requires a working installation of [Puppeteer](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot#requirements).

### Themes
The social images generator is built around the concept of themes. You need at least one theme, but can have as many as you’d like.

Run the following command to create your first theme:

```bash
php please seo:theme
```

This will publish an empty template file for each social image type to `resources/views/social_images/{theme}`.

### Templating
When building your social image templates, you most likely want to see what you’re doing. You can view your templates according to this schema:

```
https://site.test/!/advanced-seo/social-images/{theme}/{type}/{id}
```

| Variable | Description              | Values                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`  | The theme to use         | e.g. `default` or `very-special`                               |
| `type`   | The type of social image | `open-graph`, `twitter-summary`, `twitter-summary-large-image` |
| `id`     | The ID of the entry      | e.g. `4358df35-c7fe-4774-97ad-02af0e2dea3b`                    |

**Example:**

```
https://site.test/!/advanced-seo/social-images/default/open-graph/4358df35-c7fe-4774-97ad-02af0e2dea3b
https://site.test/!/advanced-seo/social-images/default/twitter-summary/4358df35-c7fe-4774-97ad-02af0e2dea3b
https://site.test/!/advanced-seo/social-images/default/twitter-summary-large-image/4358df35-c7fe-4774-97ad-02af0e2dea3b
```

### Configuration
Make sure the generator is enabled in the addon’s config. Next, head over to `SEO -> Site -> Social Media` and enable the collections you want to enable the generator for. This will add a new `Social Images Generator` section to the selected collections’ defaults and entry blueprint.

### Usage
Activate the `Generate Social Images` toggle on the entry to generate the social images. If you have multiple themes, you may select the theme of your choice in the `Themes` dropdown. The images are generated every time you save the entry. You may also disable this behavior in the config and instead generate the images the first time the entry is viewed on the frontend.

You can also run the following command to generate all images at once:

```bash
php please seo:generate-images
```

### Additional Fields
You might want to add fields to your blueprint specifically for your social images. Create a fieldset with the handle `social_images_generator` and it will add the fields directly below the social images generator. How sweet is that!

### Live Preview
You may use Statamic’s live preview feature to preview your social images when editing an entry. Simply click the `Live Preview` button and select the `Open Graph Image` or `Twitter Image` from the target dropdown.

## Sitemap
This addon automatically generates sitemaps for your collections and taxonomies. The sitemaps are organized in a sitemap index so you only have to submit one URL to Google Search Console. The sitemap index can be found at `yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml`.

### Exclude From Sitemap
You may want to exclude specific collections and taxonomies from the sitemap. Simply navigate to `SEO -> Site -> Indexing` and change the settings to your liking. You can also remove a specific entry or term from the sitemap by disabling the toggle in the SEO tab. If an entry or term has noindex enabled, it will be removed from the sitemap as well. Lastly, if you don’t want to use the sitemap feature at all, simply disable it in the config file.

### Custom Sitemaps
You can generate your own custom sitemaps, which comes in handy if you have custom routes outside of Statamic. See the example below for instructions on how to create a sitemap. This code has to go within a Service Provider to make sure the sitemap is loaded with each request.

```php
use Aerni\AdvancedSeo\Facades\Sitemap;

// Create a new sitemap URL.
$signIn = Sitemap::makeUrl('https://statamic.com/sign-in');

// You may also add optional attributes.
$seller = Sitemap::makeUrl('https://statamic.com/seller')
    ->lastmod(now())
    ->changefreq('daily')
    ->priority('1.0');

// Create a sitemap and add the items to it.
$sitemap = Sitemap::make('user')
    ->add($signIn)
    ->add($seller);

// Add your new custom sitemap to the sitemap index.
Sitemap::add($sitemap);
```

## Permissions
The addon gives you fine-grained control of your users’ permissions to view and edit the site, collection, and taxonomy defaults.
